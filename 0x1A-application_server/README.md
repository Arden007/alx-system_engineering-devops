## Overview

Welcome to the **0x1A-Application Server** project! This project focuses on enhancing your existing web infrastructure by adding an application server to handle dynamic content for your Airbnb clone project. You will integrate the application server with Nginx to create a robust and efficient web stack.

## Concepts

In this project, you will explore the following concepts:

- Web Server
- Server
- Web Stack Debugging

## Background Context

Your current web infrastructure is successfully serving web pages through Nginx, which was established in your initial web stack project. However, to handle dynamic content, an application server is needed. This project aims to seamlessly integrate the application server, connect it to Nginx, and make it serve your Airbnb clone project.

## Resources

Before proceeding, it's recommended to read or watch the following resources:

- [Application Server vs Web Server](https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/application-server-vs-web-server/)
- [How to Serve a Flask Application with Gunicorn and Nginx on Ubuntu 16.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-serve-flask-applications-with-gunicorn-and-nginx-on-ubuntu-16-04)
- [Running Gunicorn](http://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/run.html)
- [Be Careful with the Way Flask Manages Slash in Route - strict_slashes](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/quickstart/#routing)
- [Upstart Documentation](http://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/)

## Requirements

- **General**
  - Create a `README.md` file at the root of the project folder.
  - All Python-related tasks must use `python3`.
  - Comment all configuration files for clarity.
  
- **Bash Scripts**
  - All scripts will be interpreted on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.
  - All script files should end with a new line.
  - Ensure that all Bash scripts are executable.
  - All Bash scripts must pass Shellcheck (version 0.3.7-5~ubuntu16.04.1) without errors.
  - The first line of every Bash script should be `#!/usr/bin/env bash`.
  - The second line of every Bash script should be a comment explaining the script's purpose.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the **0x1A-Application Server** project:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Arden007/0x1A-Application-Server.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd 0x1A-Application-Server`
3. Install dependencies globally (for this project): `sudo apt-get install -y package-name`
4. Configure the application server settings, Nginx configuration, and application-specific parameters.
5. Run the application server using Gunicorn: `gunicorn -c config-file.py app:app`
6. Verify the setup by accessing your application through your server's IP address in a web browser.

## Key Components

The main components of this application server integration include:

- **Application Server**: Handles dynamic content, processes requests, and generates responses using Gunicorn.
- **Nginx**: Acts as a reverse proxy to efficiently distribute requests between the application server and static content.
- **Gunicorn**: A Python WSGI HTTP server that interfaces between the application server and clients.
- **Upstart**: An event-based replacement for the `/sbin/init` daemon, managing startup, running tasks, and shutdown.
- **Flask Routes**: Define routes in Flask while considering `strict_slashes` to ensure consistent URL behavior.
